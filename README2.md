// THESE ARE OLD DIRECTIONS // 
Welcome to the Virtual Alien Game.  In this game you will choose your Alien type and name.
When the game opens, you will hit 1 to create a new alien. It must have a name and you must pick a 
type by choosing either "cyborg" or "organic".

// WELCOME TO THE ALIEN GAME //
1. Open the Game (at any time you can press 0 to exit and possible save)

2. If nothing is saved, press 1 to make first alien:
    2a. First choose your culture (Plutonian or Neptunian)
    2b. Then choose your Type (organic or cyborg)
    2c. Finish by choosing your name
    
Neptunians get sweet pay. Plutonians get hot food. 

3. After you make an alien, press a button to see all the aliens in your shelter. Including their name, 
type, and hunger (or battery level if they are cyborg). 

4. You have the ability to feed all the pets or one at a time.

5. Every time you take an action, things will "tick" this ticking changes the hunger,
boredom, or finances of the alien, and, once it gets to a critical point, you need to take action
such as give them data (read a book), feed them, or acquire money at their job. 
    - Once hunger gets to a critical level-8 --- you must feed your alien. 
    - Once intelligence drops to level 2, your alien needs to read/download data 
    - Once Finances drop to level 2, your alien needs to go to work.

6. As long as an alien has decent finances and intelligence, you can release them from the shelter 
back their home planet.  *** As long as these levels are not critical.
