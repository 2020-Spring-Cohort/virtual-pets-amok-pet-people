// WELCOME TO THE ALIEN GAME //
1. Open the Game (at any time you can press 0 to exit)

2. Press 1 to make your first alien:
    2a. First choose your Alien's Name 
    2b. Then choose your Type (organic or cyborg)
    2c. Finish by choosing your race (Plutonian or Neptunian)
    
        Neptunians get extra cash when they are paid. 
        Plutonians get extra food when they are fed. 

3. After you make an alien, you can press 4 button to see all the aliens in your shelter. 
    Including their name and other characteristics. 

4. Pressing 2 will allow you to take action on all the aliens at once, while pressing
    3 will allow you to take action on just one particular alien.
    
5. Every time you take an action, things will "tick" this ticking changes the hunger,
intelligence, or finances of the alien, and, once it gets to a critical point, you need to take action
such as give them data (read a book), feed them, or acquire money at their job. 

6. You can release aliens from the shelter back their home planet by pressing 5 and picking
    the alien you would like to adopt out (please spell the name right!).
