// THESE ARE OLD DIRECTIONS // 
Welcome to the Virtual Alien Game.  In this game you will choose your Alien type and name.
When the game opens, you will hit 1 to create a new alien. It must have a name and you must pick a 
type by choosing either "cyborg" or "organic".

// WELCOME TO THE ALIEN GAME //
1. Open the Game (at any time you can press 0 to exit and possible save)

2. If nothing is saved, press 1 to make first alien:
    2a. First choose your culture (Plutonian or Neptunian)
    2b. Then choose your Type (organic or cyborg)
    2c. Finish by choosing your mame

3. After you make an alien, press a button to see all the aliens in your shelter. Including their name, 
type, and hunger (or battery level if they are cyborg). 

4. You can then press a button to feed them all if you want. 

5. Every time you take an action, things will "tick" this ticking changes the hunger,
boredom, or finances of the alien, and, once it gets to a critical point, you need to take action
such as give them data (read a book), feed them, or acquire money at their job. 

6. As long as an alien has decent finances and intelligence you can release them from the shelter 
back their home planet.
